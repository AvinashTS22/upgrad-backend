    ## API of Movies Application


    This specification describes the endpoints, request/response model for Movie Application.
    This API provides REST resources to manage project movies of Movies application.


    The resources should only be used over HTTPS (SSL) and can be accessed via the following base URL:


    ```
      https://movieapp.com/api/v1/
    ```


    ## API usage guidelines


    This section describes general rules and guidelines for using REST based
    services offered by Movies Application.

      * All resources can only be accessed via HTTPS and a respective HTTP Basic Authentication header is also required.
      * Movies Application reserves the right to add new parameters without further notice (in request and response).
      * Movies Application reserves the right to add new error codes without further notice. Movies Application will thereby stick to the HTTP STATUS CODES as defined by W3C.
      * Movies Application reserves the right to enhance enumerations by new values.
      * Movies Application reserves the right to increase the "maxItem" settings of arrays without further notice.
      
    Each consumer needs to tolerant about changes to the API as much as possible ([see Tolerant Reader Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/TolerantReader.html))


    ## Business definitions

    Movie APIs are called by an authorized application to view data on movies, artists, theatres, shows and bookings.

securityDefinitions:
  Authorization:
    type: basic
    description: >
      Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves
      security tokens called bearer tokens. The name “Bearer authentication” can be understood as “give access
      to the bearer of this token.”

      The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The
      client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

      ```
      Authorization: Bearer <token>

      ```

      Similarly to Basic authentication, Bearer authentication should only be used over HTTPS (SSL).

      Read https://jwt.io/introduction/ for more information on JWT standard.
